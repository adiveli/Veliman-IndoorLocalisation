# Veliman-IndoorLocalisation
iOS Indoor Localisation based on BLE microcontrollers

Application workflow

->Add beacons or use last added ones. For this stage of the application you can use only 3 beacons. Don't forget to calibrate for better results.
->Add map or use last configured one. For the configuring proccess place the microcontrollers in your room and measure the distances realative to a corner of the room.
->Choose a configured map and enjoy the localization process.

I used RFDuino microcontrollers for this project.(Arduino with BLE module)
